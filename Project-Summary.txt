Create Mystery Message                          Date: 10-10-2024

* First I create one user message model using mongoose and type script and after create user model with multiple fields.
=> I verified email address using regexr and check expiry using date.
=> Next js working in edge side so I export model like (exisiting schema) || (create new schema)
=>Mongoose using make schema for MongoDB

#Zode
=> TypeScript first schema validation with static type inference
=> https://github.com/colinhacks/zod
=> TypeScript is check the Schema is valid or not.

#MongoDB
=>When making Next Js application at that time check database connaction if they have already so can use it either make new mongodb connection. 
=>MongoDB return value is array and I extract first value of array and check ready state and then last export MongoDB
